## Description

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, where losing a customer is far more expensive than retaining one.  
This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** that analyzes customer behavior, billing patterns, and service usage to **identify customers at high risk of churn**.

Since the dataset is **highly imbalanced** (most customers do not churn), the project focuses on **Recall and F1-score** instead of misleading accuracy.  
The final model successfully identifies **~81% of churners**, making it useful for real-world retention strategies.
